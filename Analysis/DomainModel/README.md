The domain model for the MicroMeet system represents the core business entities and their relationships within the meetup management platform. The central entity is User, which stores essential profile information such as userId, name, email, and availability status. A User can host multiple Meetup events, forming a one-to-many association. Each Meetup contains attributes including meetupId, title, activityType, time, capacity, and description, which define the essential details of an event.

Every Meetup is associated with exactly one Location, which stores geographic information such as label, latitude, and longitude. User participation in meetups is modeled through the Participation entity, which captures the relationship between User and Meetup. This entity records participationId, status (e.g., requested, accepted, declined), and joinedAt timestamp, enabling the system to track attendee status and manage capacity.

The Notification entity represents system-generated messages triggered by meetup updates and is associated with meetups to inform participants of changes. Additionally, enumerations such as ActivityType, AvailabilityStatus, and ParticipationStatus restrict certain attributes to predefined values. Together, these entities and their associations define the structural foundation and business rules of the MicroMeet domain.
